# Data Directory

This directory contains data files used during WordPress setup.

## Directory Structure

- **products/** - Product data (generated by scripts)
- **content/** - Blog posts and pages (generated by scripts)
- **users/** - User account data (generated by scripts)
- **reviews/** - Product reviews (generated by scripts)
- **orders/** - Order templates (generated by scripts)

## Important Notes

Most data is **generated dynamically** during the setup process by the scripts in `scripts/`.

The setup scripts create realistic data on-the-fly rather than importing from static files. This approach:
- Reduces repository size
- Allows customization via .env variables
- Generates fresh data each time
- Creates realistic timestamps and relationships

## Customization

To customize the generated data, edit:
- `.env` - Adjust NUM_PRODUCTS, NUM_ORDERS, etc.
- `scripts/05-import-products.sh` - Modify product catalog
- `scripts/06-import-content.sh` - Modify blog posts
- `scripts/07-create-users.sh` - Modify user accounts
- `scripts/08-generate-orders.sh` - Modify order generation
- `scripts/09-add-reviews.sh` - Modify reviews

## Static vs Dynamic Data

**Dynamic (Generated at Runtime):**
- Products and variations
- Orders and order items
- User accounts
- Blog posts
- Product reviews
- Categories and tags

**Static (From Config Files):**
- Plugin list (`config/plugins.txt`)
- Theme selection (`config/theme.txt`)
- WordPress options (`config/wordpress-options.json`)
- WooCommerce settings (`config/woocommerce-settings.json`)

## Adding Custom Static Data

If you want to add static data files (CSV, XML, etc.):

1. Place files in appropriate subdirectory
2. Modify corresponding script to import the file
3. Update .gitignore if files are large

Example:

# Add custom products CSV
cp my-products.csv data/products/custom-products.csv

# Modify scripts/05-import-products.sh to import it
wp wc product import /tmp/data/products/custom-products.csv
